# SOW-0014 - Maintainability Hotspots

## Status

Status: completed

Sub-state: selected maintainability hotspots and the per-codec/per-service organization sweep are implemented and validated.

## Requirements

### Purpose

Improve repository hygiene by reducing real source complexity and duplication without weakening useful Codacy maintainability signals.

### User Request

The user selected keeping complexity and duplication metrics active and treating real hotspots as source remediation work, then approved proceeding with SOW-0014.

### Assistant Understanding

Facts:

- Codacy reports repository-level complexity and duplication percentages even when the current issue backlog is zero.
- Local Lizard and JSCPD approximations found real maintainability pressure in source code, not only test or fixture scope.
- Coverage upload work is tracked separately in `SOW-0013`.
- No runtime project skills exist for this repository.
- No SOW specs exist beyond `.agents/sow/specs/.gitkeep`; public docs under `docs/` remain the relevant contract surface.
- `docs/code-organization.md` requires preserving protocol, transport, and service layer boundaries.

Inferences:

- Some duplication is intentional cross-language parity or POSIX/Windows parity and should not be removed mechanically.
- The useful remediation target is high-risk source duplication and complexity that obscures protocol, transport, or service behavior.

Unknowns:

- Which hotspots are worth changing after maintainers evaluate protocol clarity, parity, and performance tradeoffs.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Identify source complexity and duplication hotspots with file-level evidence.
- Separate intentional parity duplication from avoidable implementation duplication.
- Propose user decisions before refactoring protocol, transport, or service code.
- Reduce selected real hotspots without changing public protocol/API behavior.
- Validate C, Rust, and Go tests and relevant interoperability scripts after changes.

## Analysis

Sources checked:

- `SOW-0013` local Lizard and JSCPD findings.
- `docs/code-organization.md`
- `docs/level2-typed-api.md`
- `.codacy/codacy.config.json`
- Codacy local/cloud skill guidance.

Current state:

- Highest local source complexity appeared in lookup builders/decoders, service session loops, and transport send/receive paths.
- Largest local source duplicate groups included POSIX/Windows wrapper parity, typed lookup service wrappers, and language/service parity.
- Codacy Cloud for commit `655eb62e1aa7395e3a8ec70728e7215c77306948` reports:
  - issues: 0.
  - coverage: 88%.
  - complex files: 43%.
  - duplicated files: 46%.
  - LOC: 106819.
  - `fileComplexityValueThreshold`: 20.
  - `fileDuplicationBlockThreshold`: 1.
- Enabled Codacy Cloud tools are Checkov, Cppcheck, Opengrep, Revive, ShellCheck, Spectral, and Trivy.
- Codacy Analysis CLI local run with the current config found 0 issues.
- Official Codacy documentation confirms these are file-level metrics:
  - file complexity is the sum of method cyclomatic complexity, and repository complexity is the percentage of files above the configured complexity goal.
  - file duplication is the number of clones in the file, and repository duplication is the percentage of duplicated files.

Risks:

- Refactoring protocol and transport code can break wire compatibility.
- Removing intentional duplication can make cross-language parity harder to audit.
- Performance-sensitive hot paths need benchmark evidence before accepting structural changes.

## Pre-Implementation Gate

Status: passed for the approved first target.

Problem / root-cause model:

- Working theory: Codacy's maintainability percentages include real complexity and duplication, but not all duplication is bad. Some repeated code preserves explicit cross-language or cross-platform protocol parity.
- The approved first source change is limited to the Go raw L3 cache duplicate implementation.

Evidence reviewed:

- `SOW-0013` Codacy metrics investigation.
- Local Lizard and JSCPD approximations recorded in `SOW-0013`.
- `docs/code-organization.md` layer-boundary rules.
- `docs/level2-typed-api.md` typed API ownership and lifetime rules.
- `.codacy/codacy.config.json` current local Codacy configuration.

Affected contracts and surfaces:

- C, Rust, and Go protocol, transport, and service implementations.
- Cross-language interoperability tests and benchmarks.
- Public protocol/API documentation if any behavior changes are proposed.

Existing patterns to reuse:

- Preserve layer boundaries documented in `docs/code-organization.md`.
- Preserve cross-language parity tests and benchmark scripts.

Risk and blast radius:

- Medium to high depending on selected hotspots.
- Protocol and transport refactors can affect all SDK consumers.
- Performance changes need benchmark validation.

Sensitive data handling plan:

- Do not read `.env`.
- Do not write raw secrets, credentials, tokens, customer data, personal data, private endpoints, or proprietary details into durable artifacts.

Implementation plan:

1. Reproduce local complexity and duplication reports with current tools and exact thresholds.
2. Record the user's selected first hotspot group.
3. Refactor only the selected Go raw L3 cache duplicate.
4. Run unit and build validation appropriate to touched Go code.

Validation plan:

- JSCPD before/after comparison for the selected duplicate group.
- Go tests for the touched raw service package.
- Cross-platform Go build validation for Linux and Windows package variants.
- Broader C/Rust validation is not required for this target unless the change escapes Go raw Level 3 cache code.

Artifact impact plan:

- AGENTS.md: likely unaffected unless workflow rules change.
- Runtime project skills: likely unaffected unless reusable maintainability workflow emerges.
- Specs: update only if behavior/contract changes.
- End-user/operator docs: likely unaffected because public API and behavior should stay unchanged.
- End-user/operator skills: likely unaffected because public/operator guidance should stay unchanged.
- SOW lifecycle: moved from `pending/` to `current/` after user approval to proceed; the user approved the Go raw L3 cache first target on 2026-06-04.

Open-source reference evidence:

- Not checked yet; future implementation should use local mirrored repositories only where comparable refactor patterns are relevant.

Open decisions:

- After low-risk typed service-facade cleanup is validated, switch to complexity hotspots.

## Implications And Decisions

- User decision from `SOW-0013`: keep complexity and duplication metrics active; fix real source hotspots instead of weakening useful rules.

1. First remediation target

Evidence gathered on 2026-06-03:

- Lizard 1.23.0 production-source pass:
  - 51 analyzed production source files.
  - 32 files have summed cyclomatic complexity above 20.
  - 1208 functions analyzed.
  - 39 functions have cyclomatic complexity above 20.
- Highest production-source complexity by summed file complexity:
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c`: file sum 484; `nipc_apps_lookup_builder_add` has CCN 63 at lines 1982-2198; `apps_lookup_decode_item_bytes` has CCN 49 at lines 1744-1858.
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup.go`: file sum 439; `AppsLookupBuilder.Add` has CCN 71 at lines 1253-1491; `decodeAppsLookupItem` has CCN 52 at lines 1111-1222.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs`: file sum 431; POSIX and Windows session loops have CCN 36 and 32 at lines 2272-2530 and 2050-2268.
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c`: file sum 396; `server_handle_session` has CCN 47 at lines 1135-1346.
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c`: file sum 389; `server_handle_session` has CCN 50 at lines 965-1182.
- JSCPD 4.2.4 production-source pass, excluding Go/Rust in-package tests and the Rust interop utility:
  - 37 analyzed source files.
  - 45 exact clones.
  - 1031 duplicated lines.
  - 12.74% duplicated lines.
  - service-layer duplicate groups: 29 clones, 872 duplicated lines.
  - transport duplicate groups: 14 clones, 192 duplicated lines.
  - protocol duplicate groups: 2 clones, 12 duplicated lines.
- Largest production duplicate pairs:
  - Rust typed lookup facades: `src/crates/netipc/src/service/apps_lookup.rs` and `src/crates/netipc/src/service/cgroups_lookup.rs`, 224 duplicated lines across 7 clones. Shared config and transport conversion start at `apps_lookup.rs:21` and `cgroups_lookup.rs:23`; shared client/server wrapper shape starts at `apps_lookup.rs:89` and `cgroups_lookup.rs:91`.
  - Go raw cache POSIX/Windows: `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache.go` and `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache_windows.go`, 131 duplicated lines across 5 clones. Shared cache types and refresh/lookup logic start at `cache.go:13` and `cache_windows.go:17`.
  - Go typed lookup facades: apps/cgroups and POSIX/Windows wrappers, including `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/apps_lookup/client.go:11`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup/client.go:11`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/apps_lookup/client_windows.go:11`, and `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup/client_windows.go:11`.
  - Windows SHM C transport internal duplication: `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/transport/windows/netipc_win_shm.c`, 79 duplicated lines across 4 clones around server-create and client-attach validation/name setup at lines 258 and 469.

Options:

- A. Start with typed service-facade duplication in Rust and Go.
  - Scope: extract shared wrapper/config conversion patterns while preserving public package/module names and exported API shapes.
  - Pros: attacks the largest production duplicate category; mostly Level 2 facade code; lower behavior risk than protocol or transport loops.
  - Cons: may require generics, traits, or small internal helpers; over-abstraction can make the typed API less obvious.
  - Implications: tests should cover Rust service facade compilation and Go POSIX/Windows package builds; public docs likely unchanged if exported APIs remain identical.
  - Risks: accidental API drift in service constructors or platform build tags.

- B. Start with Go raw L3 cache POSIX/Windows duplication.
  - Scope: move common cache state, refresh, lookup, status, and close logic into shared code; keep only platform-specific client construction separate.
  - Pros: smallest isolated production duplicate group; low protocol/transport risk.
  - Cons: reduces fewer duplicated lines than option A; improves one Go cache surface only.
  - Implications: Go tests should cover POSIX locally and Windows via existing Windows validation path.
  - Risks: interface extraction around platform-specific client construction could add indirection for a narrow win.

- C. Start with lookup codec builder/decoder complexity.
  - Scope: split validation, layout calculation, label writing, and item header writing in C/Rust/Go lookup codecs.
  - Pros: largest complexity reduction opportunity; directly improves wire-code readability and testability.
  - Cons: high blast radius because codec code owns wire format encode/decode.
  - Implications: requires C/Rust/Go codec tests, cross-language fixture checks, and interop validation.
  - Risks: subtle wire compatibility regression, borrowed-view lifetime bugs, or performance regression.

- D. Start with raw service session loops and transport send/receive complexity.
  - Scope: split receive, dispatch, response-status mapping, and send paths in raw managed service loops and selected transports.
  - Pros: addresses high-complexity hot paths that are hard to reason about.
  - Cons: highest behavioral and performance risk; these loops encode retry, batching, SHM/baseline selection, and close semantics.
  - Implications: broad C/Rust/Go tests, POSIX interop, Windows validation, and benchmarks are required.
  - Risks: connection lifecycle regressions, performance regressions, or cross-platform drift.

Recommendation: A first.

Reasoning:

- It targets the largest production duplicate category: service-layer duplicates are 872 of 1031 production duplicated lines.
- It avoids the wire-format and transport hot paths that carry the highest regression risk.
- It should reduce Codacy duplicated-file pressure without weakening rules or hiding intentional cross-language parity.
- After A, re-run metrics and decide whether B or C is the next best return/risk tradeoff.

Decision update on 2026-06-04:

- After reviewing the refined duplication composition, the user approved the plan to start with the Go raw L3 cache duplicate implementation.
- This supersedes the earlier broad recommendation to start with typed service facades.
- Implementation scope is limited to `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache.go`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache_windows.go`, and a shared raw-cache helper file if needed.
- Public `NewCache()` signatures and platform build tags must remain unchanged.

Decision update on 2026-06-04, C lookup codec target:

- The user confirmed that `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c` file complexity and POSIX/Windows service duplication are real hygiene issues worth improving when the change stays reasonable.
- Continue in this existing SOW instead of opening a new SOW.
- First target: reduce `netipc_protocol.c` lookup response builder complexity by extracting private C codec helpers around item layout, label layout, string writing, and directory entry writing.
- Preserve the public C protocol API, public header declarations, wire format, offsets, alignment, error codes, and cross-language fixture bytes.
- Defer POSIX/Windows service common extraction to a separate target-specific decision because it has higher lifecycle and platform-risk surface.

### Target Gate - C Lookup Codec Builder Cleanup

Problem / root-cause model:

- `netipc_protocol.c` is a high-complexity file because it contains multiple protocol families and two dense lookup response builders.
- The remaining builder complexity is concentrated in repeated fixed-string offset calculation, label table sizing, bounds checks, wire header writes, string writes, label writes, and directory updates.
- Working theory: helper extraction can improve reviewability and reduce function-level complexity without changing the wire contract.

Evidence reviewed:

- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c:1721` `nipc_cgroups_lookup_builder_add`.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c:2063` `nipc_apps_lookup_builder_add`.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c:1006` shared label storage sizing helper.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c:1186` shared label writer.
- `docs/code-organization.md` codec boundary: protocol code owns wire format encode/decode/builders and must not import transport/service logic.
- `tests/interop_codec.sh` cross-language byte-identity and decode validation covers cgroups/apps lookup response fixtures.

Affected contracts and surfaces:

- C codec internals only.
- Public C protocol header and function signatures remain unchanged.
- Cross-language C/Rust/Go fixture byte identity is an acceptance requirement.

Existing patterns to reuse:

- Keep private static helpers in `netipc_protocol.c`.
- Keep error returns as `NIPC_ERR_*`.
- Keep existing `lookup_write_labels`, `lookup_finish_common`, `align8_u64_over_limit`, and `add_u64_over_limit` helper style.

Risk and blast radius:

- Medium. The code owns wire layout, offsets, alignment, label table placement, and builder error behavior.
- Main regression risks are off-by-one NUL placement, wrong directory length, wrong relative offsets after finish, or changed overflow/error classification.

Sensitive data handling plan:

- Do not read `.env`.
- Do not write secrets, credentials, tokens, customer data, personal data, private endpoints, or proprietary details into code, docs, skills, specs, or SOW artifacts.

Implementation plan:

1. Extract a private layout struct for lookup builder item placement.
2. Extract shared fixed-string layout calculation for cgroups and apps builders.
3. Extract shared label layout calculation using existing label validation and sizing rules.
4. Extract shared directory-entry write and fixed-string write helpers.
5. Keep cgroups/apps-specific wire header construction local and explicit.

Validation plan:

- Build C code with `cmake --build build`.
- Run focused protocol tests with `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R protocol`.
- Run `bash tests/interop_codec.sh` serially after the build/protocol test.
- Run `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json`.
- Run `git diff --check`, SOW audit, and sensitive-data scan on touched files.

Artifact impact plan:

- `AGENTS.md`: no workflow or guardrail change expected.
- Runtime project skills: no reusable workflow change expected.
- Specs: no public protocol or API behavior change expected; update only if validation reveals a contract discrepancy.
- End-user/operator docs: no public usage change expected.
- End-user/operator skills: no exported/operator workflow change expected.
- SOW lifecycle: record this target and keep SOW in progress after the narrow cleanup unless the user asks to close it.

Decision update on 2026-06-04, C service common target:

- The user approved continuing in this SOW after the C lookup codec cleanup.
- Proceed with the POSIX/Windows C service duplication cleanup next.
- Target a private service-common module for platform-neutral L2/L3 logic; do not merge the POSIX and Windows session loops.
- Preserve platform-specific transport, SHM, wait, cancel, close, wakeup, and thread behavior.

Decision update on 2026-06-04, C protocol file-level complexity target:

- The user clarified that maintainability cleanup should focus on one file at a time, not batching many language/files together.
- Proceed with `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c` only.
- Goal: reduce file-level complexity by splitting the C protocol implementation by single-purpose protocol family while preserving the public C header/API and wire behavior.
- Preferred approach: move existing code mostly unchanged into private implementation files and a private internal header instead of rewriting algorithms.
- Avoid broad cross-language changes, protocol behavior changes, public header changes, and speculative refactors.

Decision update on 2026-06-04, codec-per-file architecture:

- The user strongly agreed that each service-kind codec API should have its own file in C, Rust, and Go because the SDK is expected to grow to dozens of codecs.
- Shared helpers may exist in common files, but custom request/response code for one codec must not be mixed with custom request/response code for another codec.
- Record this as a project architecture rule in `docs/code-organization.md`.
- Continue the current C protocol split by separating the mixed lookup implementation into common lookup helpers, cgroups lookup codec code, and apps lookup codec code.
- Do not batch Rust and Go in the same implementation pass; treat them as later one-language-at-a-time follow-ups after the C shape validates.

### Target Gate - C Protocol File Split

Problem / root-cause model:

- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c` is a 2448-line translation unit containing layout assertions, L1 envelope helpers, batch helpers, cgroups snapshot codecs, lookup codecs/builders, simple demo codecs, and typed dispatch helpers.
- Current Lizard evidence after previous cleanup: 1973 NLOC, 81 functions, average CCN 5.5, no function above the Codacy-managed CCN 20 threshold.
- Working theory: the remaining Codacy file-level complexity pressure is caused by many separate protocol goals concentrated in one file, not by a single function that needs algorithmic rewriting.

Evidence reviewed:

- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c:1` whole file.
- `CMakeLists.txt:38` builds `netipc_protocol` from a single source file.
- Highest remaining C functions in the file are below CCN 20: `apps_lookup_validate_known`, `lookup_validate_labels`, and `apps_lookup_decode_item_bytes`.
- `tests/interop_codec.sh` validates byte-identical C/Rust/Go protocol fixture generation and decode paths.

Affected contracts and surfaces:

- Private C implementation files under `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/`.
- `CMakeLists.txt` source list for the `netipc_protocol` static library.
- Public `src/libnetdata/netipc/include/netipc/netipc_protocol.h` must remain unchanged.
- Public exported symbols and wire bytes must remain unchanged.

Existing patterns to reuse:

- Keep one public protocol library target named `netipc_protocol`.
- Keep private implementation details under `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/`.
- Keep static layout assertions and exact wire-size guarantees.
- Keep C11, no generated code, no new repo dependency.

Risk and blast radius:

- Low to medium. The intended change is mostly source movement, but splitting static helpers can create link errors or subtle duplicate/private-definition mistakes.
- Main behavioral risks are missing a static helper, accidentally changing helper linkage, omitting a source file from CMake, or changing compile-time layout assertions.

Sensitive data handling plan:

- Do not read `.env`.
- Do not write secrets, credentials, tokens, customer data, personal data, private endpoints, or proprietary details into code, docs, skills, specs, or SOW artifacts.

Implementation plan:

1. Add a private protocol internal header for shared private wire structs and small shared helpers.
2. Keep core envelope, batch, hello, simple demo codecs, typed dispatch helpers, and layout assertions in `netipc_protocol.c`.
3. Move cgroups snapshot codec/builder code to a private `netipc_protocol_cgroups.c`.
4. Move cgroups/apps lookup request/response helpers and builders to a private `netipc_protocol_lookup.c`.
5. Update `CMakeLists.txt` so `netipc_protocol` links all protocol implementation files.

Validation plan:

- `cmake --build build --target netipc_protocol test_protocol interop_codec_c fuzz_protocol`.
- `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R protocol`.
- `bash tests/interop_codec.sh` serially after the build/protocol test.
- Codacy-managed Lizard on the split C protocol files.
- `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json`.
- `git diff --check`, SOW audit, and sensitive-data scan on touched durable artifacts.

Artifact impact plan:

- `AGENTS.md`: no workflow or guardrail change expected.
- Runtime project skills: no reusable workflow change expected.
- Specs: no public protocol or API behavior change expected; update only if validation reveals a contract discrepancy.
- End-user/operator docs: no public usage change expected.
- End-user/operator skills: no exported/operator workflow change expected.
- SOW lifecycle: record this target and keep the SOW in progress pending metric re-check.

### Target Gate - C Service Common Extraction

Problem / root-cause model:

- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c` duplicate substantial service orchestration code.
- Some duplication is intentional because POSIX and Windows transports differ in polling, wakeup, cancellation, SHM object preparation, and thread lifecycle.
- Working theory: extracting platform-neutral service helpers can reduce real duplication while keeping the critical platform paths readable and explicit.

Evidence reviewed:

- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:144` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c:141` duplicate power-of-two sizing helpers.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:157` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c:154` duplicate buffer sizing helpers.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:587` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c:578` duplicate call retry state-machine structure but differ in sleep/drain timing.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:703` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c:693` duplicate lookup request-size helpers.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:1039` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c:1231` duplicate typed dispatch.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:1876` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c:1871` duplicate L3 cgroups cache logic with only allocator fault-site and monotonic-clock differences.
- `docs/code-organization.md` confirms service modules own Level 2 retry/managed server orchestration and Level 3 cache helpers, while transport mechanics remain below the service layer.

Affected contracts and surfaces:

- C private service implementation and CMake build inputs.
- Public C service API signatures remain unchanged.
- POSIX and Windows behavior must remain platform-specific where the transport lifecycle differs.

Existing patterns to reuse:

- Keep platform files as the owner of transport calls and OS primitives.
- Keep common code private under `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/`.
- Keep fault-injection sites preserved through platform-provided allocator callbacks for shared cache code.

Risk and blast radius:

- Medium. Service code owns connection retry, typed calls, managed server dispatch, and cache refresh behavior.
- Main regression risks are changed reconnect timing, changed error mapping, changed response overflow handling, lost fault-injection coverage, or Windows/POSIX lifecycle drift.

Sensitive data handling plan:

- Do not read `.env`.
- Do not write secrets, credentials, tokens, customer data, personal data, private endpoints, or proprietary details into code, docs, skills, specs, or SOW artifacts.

Implementation plan:

1. Add private `netipc_service_common.h/.c`.
2. Move platform-neutral sizing, default payload, request-size, response-status, typed-dispatch, client status/close-buffer, and L3 cache helpers into the common module.
3. Keep platform files responsible for fault injection wrappers, transport config conversion, connection attempts, send/receive, session loops, accept loops, and OS-specific shutdown.
4. Link the common source into both POSIX and Windows service libraries.

Validation plan:

- Build C code with `cmake --build build`.
- Run focused C service tests with `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R 'service|cache'`.
- Run POSIX interop scripts affected by service/cache: `bash tests/test_service_interop.sh`, `bash tests/test_service_shm_interop.sh`, `bash tests/test_cache_interop.sh`, and `bash tests/test_cache_shm_interop.sh` when available on the local platform.
- Run `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json`.
- Run `git diff --check`, SOW audit, and sensitive-data scan on touched files.

Artifact impact plan:

- `AGENTS.md`: no workflow or guardrail change expected.
- Runtime project skills: no reusable workflow change expected.
- Specs: no public protocol/API behavior change expected; update only if validation reveals a contract discrepancy.
- End-user/operator docs: no public usage change expected.
- End-user/operator skills: no exported/operator workflow change expected.
- SOW lifecycle: record this target and keep SOW in progress unless the user asks to close it.

Decision update on 2026-06-04, Rust raw service organization:

- The user confirmed that `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` has the same maintainability problem as the former mixed lookup codec files: service/method-specific code is accumulated in a shared implementation file.
- Proceed with splitting dedicated Rust raw service/method code into separate files while keeping the public typed service facades unchanged.
- Keep shared raw client/server transport, retry, receive, session-loop, and envelope logic in shared raw infrastructure files.
- Move service/method-specific raw client calls, typed handler aliases, and dispatch adapters into one file per service/method.
- Move the cgroups Level 3 cache into its own cgroups cache file.
- After the structural split, remove duplicated raw call/send paths by using one request-buffer-based call path with explicit batch metadata.

### Target Gate - Rust Raw Service Organization

Problem / root-cause model:

- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` is a high-complexity 2811-line Rust module because it combines raw client lifecycle, typed service calls, method dispatch adapters, managed server accept/session loops, transport send/receive paths, and the cgroups Level 3 cache.
- The root architectural problem is not only file size. New Rust service methods currently require edits to shared raw constructors, shared typed call methods, and shared dispatch adapter code.
- The duplicated call/send paths exist because small fixed requests use borrowed payload slices while dynamic requests use `self.request_buf`, and batch requests have a third envelope variant. This should be represented as one shared raw request shape, not three copied retry/envelope/send implementations.

Evidence reviewed:

- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:7` imports service/method-specific codec APIs into the shared raw module.
- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:157` through `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:184` contains method-specific client constructors.
- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:293` through `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:469` contains method-specific typed client calls.
- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:1439` through `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:1573` contains method-specific handler aliases and dispatch adapters.
- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:2578` through `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:2799` contains cgroups Level 3 cache code mixed into the same raw module.
- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:642`, `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:726`, and `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:805` show three duplicated retry loops.
- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:889`, `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:938`, and `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:979` show three duplicated request/response envelope paths.
- `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:1027` and `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs:1119` show duplicated transport send paths for borrowed payload and request-buffer payload.
- `docs/code-organization.md` requires service modules to keep service-specific request/response orchestration clear and preserve one service endpoint per request kind.
- `docs/level2-typed-api.md` requires Level 2 to own typed wrappers, retry policy, managed server mode, and service-specific typed dispatch while keeping transport details invisible to public callers.

Affected contracts and surfaces:

- Rust private service implementation under `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` and new child files under `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/`.
- Public Rust typed facades in `src/crates/netipc/src/service/cgroups.rs`, `src/crates/netipc/src/service/cgroups_lookup.rs`, and `src/crates/netipc/src/service/apps_lookup.rs` must keep their existing public API.
- Rust raw helpers are documented as internal/test helpers, but benchmark and fixture binaries import some raw symbols directly; existing raw symbol names must remain re-exported.
- Protocol wire bytes, transport behavior, retry semantics, response-view borrowing lifetime, and managed-server behavior must remain unchanged.

Existing patterns to reuse:

- Keep public typed service facades explicit and service-kind specific.
- Mirror the Rust protocol split pattern: wrapper module plus child files, with common helpers separated from service/method-specific files.
- Mirror the existing Go raw package shape where client/server/cache and lookup client code are not all in one source file.
- Keep `raw.rs` as the `service::raw` module entry point and re-export existing raw symbols to avoid changing call sites.

Risk and blast radius:

- Medium. Most of the change is source organization, but the request-buffer call-path cleanup touches retry, overflow recovery, response envelope validation, response borrowing, batching, and SHM/baseline send paths.
- Main regression risks are changed reconnect counts, changed overflow recovery behavior, wrong response item-count validation for batches, broken borrowed response lifetime, missed raw symbol re-export, or platform-specific compile failures.
- Windows validation is needed because the raw module contains cfg-gated Windows client/server/session logic.

Sensitive data handling plan:

- Do not read `.env`.
- Do not write secrets, credentials, tokens, customer data, personal data, private endpoints, or proprietary details into code, docs, skills, specs, or SOW artifacts.

Implementation plan:

1. Convert `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` into a wrapper module that declares child files and re-exports the existing raw public/internal symbols.
2. Move shared client state/lifecycle, request-buffer raw call logic, transport send/receive, and response borrowing into raw client infrastructure files.
3. Move managed server state, accept loops, session loops, dispatch plumbing, and platform-specific prepared-SHM helper into raw server infrastructure files.
4. Move cgroups snapshot, cgroups lookup, apps lookup, increment, and string-reverse typed raw calls plus dispatch adapters into service/method-specific child files.
5. Move cgroups Level 3 cache code into a dedicated cgroups cache child file.
6. Replace the three duplicated retry/envelope/send paths with one request-buffer-based raw call path using explicit batch metadata.

Validation plan:

- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml -- --check`.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml`.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml --test` is not applicable because this crate uses in-package tests and fixture binaries, so use the full Cargo test command above.
- `bash tests/interop_codec.sh` is not directly required for raw service-only source movement, but run full Rust tests and service interop because raw service behavior is touched.
- `bash tests/test_service_interop.sh`.
- `bash tests/test_service_shm_interop.sh`.
- `bash tests/test_cache_interop.sh`.
- `bash tests/test_cache_shm_interop.sh`.
- Windows/MSYS validation over SSH `win11` for Rust raw service compile/tests if local changes pass.
- `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json`.
- `git diff --check`, `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh`, and sensitive-data scan over touched durable artifacts.

Artifact impact plan:

- `AGENTS.md`: no workflow or guardrail change expected.
- Runtime project skills: no reusable workflow change expected unless this refactor reveals a repeatable Rust service-addition workflow.
- Specs: update `docs/code-organization.md` if the Rust service raw layout changes documented repository structure or service-addition guidance.
- End-user/operator docs: no public API or behavior change expected.
- End-user/operator skills: update `docs/netipc-integrator-skill.md` if it still points new service work at the old monolithic raw Rust file.
- SOW lifecycle: record the target and keep the SOW in progress after validation unless the user asks to close it.

2. Duplication composition refinement

Context:

- The goal is not zero duplication. The goal is to remove duplication only where it improves maintainability without hiding protocol, language, or platform parity.
- JSCPD duplicate line counts by pair are an upper-bound gain estimate. They are not strictly additive because the same block can participate in more than one clone pair.

Whole repository composition from the `src tests bench` JSCPD report:

- External fixtures/tests: 3204 clone-pair lines, 149 clones, 67 pairs.
  - Interpretation: mostly validation scaffolding and cross-language fixture parity.
  - Recommendation: keep explicit unless a specific fixture maintenance problem appears.
  - Risk of refactoring: high clarity risk; tests become less direct and less diagnostic.
- In-package tests under `src/`: 1020 clone-pair lines, 68 clones, 23 pairs.
  - Interpretation: mostly repeated test setup/assertion patterns.
  - Recommendation: keep most of it; extract only tiny local helpers when a file is actively touched.
  - Risk of refactoring: medium; over-abstracted tests become harder to read.
- Production source: 45 clones, 21 pairs, 1031 duplicated lines in the filtered production-source report.
  - Interpretation: the only scope worth considering for source remediation in this SOW.

Production-source duplication groups, with gain and risk:

- Go typed service facade/platform wrappers: 384 clone-pair lines, 11 clones, 8 pairs.
  - Evidence examples: `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups/client.go:27` vs `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups/client_windows.go:27`; `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/apps_lookup/client.go:5` vs `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup/client.go:5`.
  - Potential gain: high for duplicated production service wrapper files.
  - Risk: medium; must preserve package names, exported API, build tags, and public constructor behavior.
  - Recommendation: fix only if the extraction stays small and internal.
- Rust apps/cgroups typed lookup facades: 224 clone-pair lines, 7 clones, 1 pair.
  - Evidence: `src/crates/netipc/src/service/apps_lookup.rs:19` vs `src/crates/netipc/src/service/cgroups_lookup.rs:21`.
  - Potential gain: high; one large isolated facade duplicate.
  - Risk: medium; traits/generics can make a simple typed API harder to inspect.
  - Recommendation: fix with a small shared internal helper only if public facade readability remains good.
- Go raw L3 cache POSIX/Windows duplicate implementation: 131 clone-pair lines, 5 clones, 1 pair.
  - Evidence: `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache.go:11` vs `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache_windows.go:15`.
  - Potential gain: medium.
  - Risk: low to medium; platform-specific client construction must remain separate.
  - Recommendation: good candidate if the shared cache logic can move to platform-neutral code.
- Rust cgroups snapshot vs cgroups lookup facade overlap: 86 clone-pair lines, 3 clones, 1 pair.
  - Evidence: `src/crates/netipc/src/service/cgroups.rs:8` vs `src/crates/netipc/src/service/cgroups_lookup.rs:6`.
  - Potential gain: medium.
  - Risk: medium; snapshot and lookup are different service contracts.
  - Recommendation: consider only together with the Rust typed-facade cleanup.
- C Windows SHM internal repeated setup/receive logic: 79 clone-pair lines, 4 clones, 1 pair.
  - Evidence: `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/transport/windows/netipc_win_shm.c:474` vs `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/transport/windows/netipc_win_shm.c:265`.
  - Potential gain: medium.
  - Risk: medium to high; transport setup and recovery paths are platform-sensitive.
  - Recommendation: do not start here unless Windows SHM code is already being changed.
- Go Windows SHM internal repeated setup/receive logic: 56 clone-pair lines, 5 clones, 1 pair.
  - Evidence: `src/go/pkg/netipc/transport/windows/shm.go:334` vs `src/go/pkg/netipc/transport/windows/shm.go:171`.
  - Potential gain: low to medium.
  - Risk: medium to high; Windows SHM behavior is sensitive.
  - Recommendation: keep explicit for now.
- C POSIX SHM internal repeated setup/receive logic: 27 clone-pair lines, 2 clones, 1 pair.
  - Evidence: `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/transport/posix/netipc_shm.c:536` vs `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/transport/posix/netipc_shm.c:369`.
  - Potential gain: low.
  - Risk: high relative to gain.
  - Recommendation: keep explicit.
- Small local duplicates: 67 clone-pair lines across Go raw service types, Go/POSIX SHM, Rust service/protocol local helpers, C POSIX/Windows SHM parity, and Go protocol frame helpers.
  - Evidence examples: `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/types.go:213`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/frame.go:346`, `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/cgroups.rs:449`.
  - Potential gain: low.
  - Risk: low to high depending on file, but poor return overall.
  - Recommendation: leave alone unless touched for another reason.

Refined recommendation:

- First useful target: Go raw L3 cache or typed service facades, depending on desired blast radius.
- Best balance: Go raw L3 cache first if the goal is a safe first cleanup; typed service facades first if the goal is maximum duplication reduction.
- Do not refactor transport or codec code only to satisfy duplication metrics.

## Plan

1. Refresh metric evidence.
2. Present hotspot options.
3. Implement selected source remediation.
4. Validate behavior and metrics.

## Execution Log

### 2026-06-03

- Created as follow-up from `SOW-0013`.
- Moved to `current/` after the user approved proceeding.
- Loaded Codacy local/cloud skill guidance for local and remote analysis workflow.
- Checked project-local SOW specs and runtime project skills:
  - `.agents/sow/specs/` contains only `.gitkeep`.
  - no `.agents/skills/project-*/SKILL.md` files exist.
- Read `docs/code-organization.md` and `docs/level2-typed-api.md` to preserve layer boundaries and typed API contracts during hotspot analysis.
- Confirmed `codacy` and `codacy-analysis` are installed.
- Confirmed `lizard` and `jscpd` are not currently on `PATH`; local report generation will use tool-local runners or user-local installations without modifying repository dependencies.

### 2026-06-04

- The user approved the refined plan to start with the Go raw L3 cache duplicate implementation.
- Extracted shared raw cache state, refresh, lookup, status, and close logic into `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache_common.go`.
- Kept POSIX and Windows `NewCache()` constructors in the existing build-tagged files:
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache.go`
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/cache_windows.go`
- Preserved public `NewCache()` signatures and platform-specific transport configuration types.
- Kept platform-specific client construction in the build-tagged files; the shared helper accepts the already constructed raw `Client`.
- The shared cache logic uses the checked `uint32` conversion path that was already present in the POSIX implementation.
- Committed and pushed the raw-cache cleanup as `e762aef` with message `Refactor Go raw cache implementation`.
- GitHub reported the direct push bypassed the pull-request rule for `main`, as requested by the user.
- Reviewed typed service-facade duplication for obvious low-risk and useful cleanup:
  - Useful/low-risk: same-package Go POSIX/Windows wrappers in `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups/`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/apps_lookup/`, and `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup/`.
  - Reason: common wrapper code can move to untagged files inside the same package, while platform transport config conversion remains in build-tagged files.
  - Rejected for now: cross-service Go abstraction between apps lookup and cgroups lookup, because it would require generic/internal indirection across public service packages for modest readability gain.
  - Rejected for now: Rust apps/cgroups lookup facade abstraction, because it would likely require traits/generics/macros around service-specific public types and would make the facade less direct.
- Applied the low-risk Go typed-facade cleanup:
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups/client_common.go`
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups/cache_common.go`
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/apps_lookup/client_common.go`
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup/client_common.go`
- Left build-tagged Go files responsible only for POSIX/Windows transport config conversion and platform-specific `NewCache()` construction where needed.
- Committed and pushed the typed-facade cleanup as `ef9fcef` with message `Refactor Go service facade wrappers`.
- GitHub reported the direct push bypassed the pull-request rule for `main`, as requested by the user.
- Switched to the lookup codec complexity target.
- Extracted apps lookup semantic validation into one local helper per language:
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup.go`
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup.rs`
- The codec change intentionally did not change layout offsets, byte-order writes, label table construction, directory entries, or packed-data compaction.
- The extracted helpers preserve the existing validation order: status domain, cgroup-status domain, comm length, unknown-pid metadata rules, known-pid/cgroup-state rules, then source-string validation in builder paths.
- Continued the lookup codec complexity target with cgroups lookup builders:
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup.go`
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup.rs`
- Extracted cgroups lookup semantic validation into one local helper per language.
- Extracted cgroups lookup label-table writing into one local helper per language.
- The cgroups lookup change intentionally did not change item offsets, label table layout, string storage order, directory entries, response finishing, or packed-data compaction.
- Label source validation remains in the existing layout calculation path before label storage is written.
- Investigated the failing GitHub Actions check `Go Static Analysis (src/go)` on commit `879c521`.
- The failing job reported that `gosec` found issues and uploaded SARIF; GitHub code scanning exposed five open `G115` alerts:
  - alerts `7574`, `7575`, and `7576` at `pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup.go:1192`.
  - alerts `7577` and `7578` at `pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup.go:757`.
  - all five were `integer overflow conversion int -> uint64` from helper-call casts in the Go lookup codec.
- Fixed the Go code-scanning findings by changing the Go lookup semantic helper length/count parameters to `int`, removing the introduced `int -> uint64` casts instead of suppressing `G115`.
- Continued the apps lookup builder complexity target:
  - reused the extracted lookup label writer from both cgroups and apps lookup builders in Go, C, and Rust.
  - kept item offsets, label-table layout, string storage order, directory entries, response finishing, and packed-data compaction unchanged.
- User decision on 2026-06-04: proceed with option B, one more low-risk cleanup by splitting apps lookup semantic validation, then stop and re-check Codacy metrics.
- Implemented option B by splitting apps lookup semantic validation into local domain, unknown-pid, and known-pid helpers in:
  - `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup.go`
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup.rs`
- The apps lookup semantic validation split preserves the existing order: status domain, cgroup-status domain, comm length, unknown-pid zero-field checks, then known-pid cgroup-state checks.
- The apps lookup semantic validation split intentionally did not change decode offsets, builder layout, label table storage, directory entries, response finishing, serialization, or public APIs.
- Continued with the approved C service common target.
- Added private common service implementation files:
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_common.c`
  - `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_common.h`
- Linked the common source into both C service libraries in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Moved platform-neutral C service helpers into the common module:
  - payload-size and power-of-two growth helpers.
  - default cgroups request/response payload sizes.
  - common client initialization, status, and buffer cleanup.
  - request-size calculations for cgroups lookup and apps lookup.
  - response transport-status mapping.
  - typed server dispatch and response header/result handling.
  - L3 cgroups cache refresh, lookup, status, and close logic.
- Kept platform files responsible for OS-specific behavior:
  - POSIX and Windows transport config conversion.
  - connection setup, reconnect timing, send/receive calls, and SHM attachment.
  - server session loops, accept loops, drain/stop/destroy lifecycle, wakeups, cancellation, and thread handling.
- Preserved platform-specific cache allocation fault sites through callback tables in `netipc_service.c` and `netipc_service_win.c`.
- Did not merge POSIX and Windows session loops because they still encode different lifecycle, wait, wakeup, and cancellation behavior.
- Continued with the approved Rust raw service organization target.
- Converted `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` into a small wrapper module that declares child files and re-exports the existing raw symbols used by tests, fixtures, and typed facades.
- Split Rust raw shared infrastructure into dedicated files:
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/client.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/server.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/server_session_unix.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/server_session_windows.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/dispatch.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/common.rs`
- Moved Rust service/method-specific raw code into one file per service/method:
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/cgroups_snapshot.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/cgroups_lookup.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/apps_lookup.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/increment.rs`
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/string_reverse.rs`
- Moved Rust cgroups Level 3 cache code into `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/cgroups_cache.rs`.
- Replaced the duplicated borrowed-payload, request-buffer, and batch raw call paths with one request-buffer-based retry/envelope/send path that carries explicit batch metadata.
- Kept public typed service facades unchanged and kept existing raw symbol names re-exported from `service::raw`.

    - largest remaining production duplicate surfaces are Rust typed facades and SHM transport internals, not the C POSIX/Windows service files targeted here.
  - Windows/MSYS validation on remote host `win11`:
    - The current uncommitted tree was copied to a fresh remote validation directory with `.git/`, build outputs, `.env`, and unrelated local scratch files excluded.
    - Environment: `MSYSTEM=MSYS`, `/usr/bin/gcc`, `/usr/bin/g++`, `/usr/bin/cmake`, `/usr/bin/ninja`, Windows Cargo from the Windows user-profile Cargo directory, and Go from `/c/Program Files/Go/bin`.
    - Targeted Windows/MSYS build passed for named-pipe, WinSHM, service, cache, stress, and C/Rust/Go interop targets; this compiled `netipc_service_common.c` and `netipc_service_win.c` into `libnetipc_service_win.a`.
    - Targeted Windows/MSYS CTest slice passed: 12/12 tests:
      - `test_named_pipe`
      - `test_named_pipe_interop`
      - `test_win_shm`
      - `test_win_service`
      - `test_win_service_extra`
      - `test_win_service_payload_limits`
      - `test_win_stress`
      - `test_win_shm_interop`
      - `test_service_win_interop`
      - `test_service_win_shm_interop`
      - `test_cache_win_interop`
      - `test_cache_win_shm_interop`
    - Full Windows/MSYS `cmake --build build-msys-validation -j12` passed.
    - Full Windows/MSYS `ctest` initially reported 32/34 passing. The two failures were investigated:
      - `interop_codec` failed because the first remote copy included a stale local Linux Rust `src/crates/netipc/target/debug/interop_codec` artifact; after deleting the remote temp Cargo target directory, `ctest -R '^interop_codec$'` passed.
      - `go_FuzzDecodeCgroupsLookupResponse` failed once with `context deadline exceeded` after the 20-second fuzz deadline; immediate rerun with `ctest -R '^go_FuzzDecodeCgroupsLookupResponse$'` passed.
- Windows/MSYS service/cache tests and cross-language interop are therefore validated for this change. The dirty-transfer artifact is not a repository failure; the single fuzz timeout is recorded as a timing flake in the full Windows smoke suite.

### 2026-06-04 Code Scanning Repair

- After commit `94907bf`, GitHub CodeQL reported two open `cpp/constant-comparison` alerts:
  - alert `7579`: `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_common.c`, apps lookup request-size additive overflow guard.
  - alert `7580`: `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_common.c`, apps lookup request-size additive overflow guard.
- The alerts are valid for 64-bit builds because `pid_count` is `uint32_t` and the apps lookup directory/key constants are small enough that the additive `SIZE_MAX` comparisons cannot become true on 64-bit `size_t`.
- The extracted common helper accidentally made the additive guard unconditional; the original POSIX helper guarded equivalent checks with `#if SIZE_MAX <= UINT32_MAX`.
- Repair plan: restore the conditional 32-bit-only additive overflow guard and keep the existing multiplication guards plus caller-side `req_size > UINT32_MAX` checks.
- Risk: low. The change affects only a static-analysis-visible overflow guard in the private C service helper. It does not change request encoding, public APIs, transport behavior, or the 64-bit runtime path.
- Repair implemented by guarding the apps lookup additive overflow check with `#if SIZE_MAX <= UINT32_MAX`.
- Validation:
  - `cmake --build build` passed.
  - `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R 'service|cache'` passed: 13/13 focused service/cache tests.
  - `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json` passed with 0 issues across Checkov, Opengrep/Semgrep, Trivy, cppcheck, ShellCheck, and Spectral.
  - Windows/MSYS rebuild on `win11` passed for `netipc_service_win`, `test_win_service`, `test_win_service_extra`, `test_win_service_payload_limits`, `interop_service_win_c`, and `interop_cache_win_c`.
  - Windows/MSYS CTest service slice passed: `test_win_service`, `test_win_service_extra`, and `test_win_service_payload_limits`.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh` passed.

### 2026-06-04 GitHub AI Quality Findings Review

- The GitHub quality AI findings page reported seven findings across typed Go service wrappers and C Windows service code.
- Response-batch mapping findings:
  - Reported files include `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/apps_lookup/client.go`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups/client.go`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup/client.go`, `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup/client_windows.go`, and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c`.
  - Same-failure search also found the equivalent Go Windows apps lookup wrapper and POSIX C service mapping.
  - Decision: reject these as false positives, but clarify the code.
  - Evidence: public typed Go configs expose `MaxRequestBatchItems` and `MaxResponsePayloadBytes`, but no `MaxResponseBatchItems`; C `nipc_client_config_t` and `nipc_server_config_t` likewise expose only `max_request_batch_items` and `max_response_payload_bytes`.
  - Evidence: `docs/level1-wire-envelope.md` says `max_response_batch_items` is kept for wire symmetry and the agreed response batch count must equal the agreed request batch count.
  - Implementation plan: keep behavior unchanged, but route response-batch assignments through private helpers named as typed response-batch symmetry helpers so future reviewers do not interpret the mapping as accidental copy-paste.
- Lookup request-payload default finding:
  - Reported file: `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c`.
  - Same-failure search found the equivalent POSIX C lookup server initializers.
  - Decision: reject as intentional behavior, but clarify the code.
  - Evidence: `docs/level2-typed-api.md` says typed callers do not provide `max_request_payload_bytes`; the library derives the initial proposal internally from method schema, batch size, and dynamic-field assumptions.
  - Evidence: lookup requests contain dynamic path/PID arrays, and C lookup servers pre-size accepted-session SHM resources from `learned_request_payload_bytes` before serving typed requests.
  - Risk of applying the suggested change: changing lookup server request defaults from the larger lookup default to the generic request default could add avoidable reconnect churn or undersized SHM setup for lookup workloads.
  - Implementation plan: keep behavior unchanged, but replace direct `cgroups_response_payload_default()` calls in lookup request-default sites with a private helper named as a lookup request-payload default.
  - Implemented:
    - C POSIX and Windows typed service config conversion now routes response-batch symmetry through `nipc_service_common_typed_response_batch_items()`.
    - C POSIX and Windows lookup server request defaults now route through `nipc_service_common_lookup_request_payload_default()`.
    - Go POSIX and Windows typed service wrappers for apps lookup, cgroups lookup, and cgroups snapshot now route response-batch symmetry through per-package `typedResponseBatchItems()` helpers.
  - Same-failure verification: no remaining direct `MaxResponseBatchItems: config.MaxRequestBatchItems` or `max_response_batch_items = config->max_request_batch_items` assignments in typed service wrappers.
  - `cmake --build build` passed.
  - `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R 'service|cache'` passed: 13/13 focused service/cache tests.
  - POSIX Go typed-service package tests passed for apps lookup, cgroups lookup, and cgroups snapshot.
  - Windows Go typed-service package compilation/tests passed for apps lookup, cgroups lookup, and cgroups snapshot.
  - Windows/MSYS rebuild passed for `netipc_service_win`, `test_win_service`, `test_win_service_extra`, `test_win_service_payload_limits`, `interop_service_win_c`, and `interop_cache_win_c`.
  - Windows/MSYS CTest service slice passed: `test_win_service`, `test_win_service_extra`, and `test_win_service_payload_limits`.
  - `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json` passed:
    - Checkov: 0 issues.
    - Opengrep/Semgrep: 0 issues.
    - Trivy: 0 issues.
    - cppcheck: 0 issues.
    - ShellCheck: 0 issues.
    - Spectral: 0 issues.
  - total: 0 issues, 0 errors.
  - `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh` passed and reported SOW initialization complete and clean.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - Sensitive-data scan across the touched SOW, Go service wrappers, and C service files returned no matches.

Sensitive data gate:

- `.env` was not read.
- No raw secrets, credentials, tokens, customer data, personal data, private endpoints, or proprietary details were written to this SOW.
- Local report artifacts remain under temporary paths and are summarized here without sensitive values.

## Outcome

Raw cache, Go typed-facade, apps lookup builder, cgroups lookup builder, apps lookup semantic validation, five Go code-scanning findings, C lookup builder function-level complexity, C POSIX/Windows service helper duplication, Rust raw-service organization, and the final per-codec/per-service organization sweep are implemented and validated.

### 2026-06-04 Windows CI And CodeQL Coverage

- User decision: add Windows CI coverage after discovering that current CodeQL coverage is Linux-shaped, not a CodeQL product limit.
- Purpose: make Windows runtime and Windows static-analysis coverage first-class CI signals for this cross-platform SDK.
- Evidence:
  - `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` currently runs every matrix entry on `ubuntu-latest`.
  - The C/C++ CodeQL job currently builds only POSIX targets: `netipc_protocol`, `netipc_uds`, `netipc_shm`, and `netipc_service`.
  - The Go CodeQL job currently runs `go test ./...` on Linux, so Windows-only Go files guarded by `//go:build windows` are not extracted.
  - `CMakeLists.txt` already has Windows runtime targets guarded by `NETIPC_WINDOWS_RUNTIME`.
  - Existing Windows validation scripts and local validation use MSYS2/MinGW, not MSVC.
- Decision:
  - Add GitHub-hosted Windows CI on `windows-latest`.
  - Use MSYS2/MinGW for the Windows runtime build because it matches the existing tested Windows scripts.
  - Keep heavyweight Windows coverage and benchmark jobs out of push/PR CI for now; they remain explicit scripts.
  - Add Windows CodeQL jobs for C/C++ and Go so Windows-only sources are extracted.
- Risk:
  - Windows hosted runners may expose timing flakiness in named-pipe/SHM tests.
  - Adding MSYS2 introduces another pinned CI action and package-install surface.
  - CodeQL Windows jobs increase CI time and may surface a new backlog of valid Windows-only findings.
- Validation plan:
  - Run local action/workflow linting.
  - Run relevant local CMake/Go validation.
  - Push and verify GitHub Windows runtime and CodeQL jobs.
- Implemented:
  - Added a `windows-latest` MSYS2/MinGW runtime job to `.github/workflows/runtime-safety.yml`.
  - Expanded CodeQL into distinct POSIX and Windows categories for C/C++ and Go.
  - Expanded POSIX C/C++ CodeQL build targets so test, interop, cache, stress, hardening, and benchmark C sources are compiled during extraction.
  - Added Windows C/C++ CodeQL build targets for named pipe, Windows SHM, Windows service, Windows interop, guard, stress, and benchmark C sources.
  - Added Windows Go CodeQL build execution so Windows build-tagged Go packages are extracted.
- Local validation:
  - YAML parsing passed for `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` and `.github/workflows/runtime-safety.yml`.
  - `actionlint .github/workflows/codeql.yml .github/workflows/runtime-safety.yml` passed.
  - POSIX expanded C/C++ CodeQL target list built locally with `cmake --build build`.
  - Windows/MSYS runtime build command passed on the Windows validation host.
  - Windows/MSYS runtime CTest slice passed on the Windows validation host: 12/12 targeted Windows tests.
  - Windows Go CodeQL build command passed on the Windows validation host for `src/go`, `tests/fixtures/go`, and `bench/drivers/go`.
  - Windows C/C++ CodeQL-only `bench_windows_c` target built on the Windows validation host.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh` passed.
  - `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json` passed with 0 issues and 0 errors across Checkov, Opengrep/Semgrep, Trivy, cppcheck, ShellCheck, and Spectral.

### 2026-06-04 Expanded CodeQL Findings

- After commit `97557fd`, GitHub CodeQL reported 56 open code-scanning alerts, all from category `/language:c-cpp-posix`.
- Evidence from GitHub code scanning:
  - `cpp/path-injection`: 12 high alerts across POSIX SHM production transport, C interop fixtures, fuzz helper, and POSIX benchmark helper.
  - `cpp/world-writable-file-creation`: 2 high alerts in C test/interop helpers.
  - `cpp/wrong-type-format-argument`: 1 high alert in C ping-pong test output.
  - `cpp/stack-address-escape`: 4 warning alerts across C POSIX service, payload-limit test, and benchmark helper.
  - `cpp/unused-local-variable`: 31 note alerts in C tests and benchmark helper.
  - `cpp/unused-static-function`: 5 note alerts in C protocol/SHM tests.
  - `cpp/long-switch`: 1 note alert in C UDS fault-response test.
- Root-cause model:
  - The stronger C/C++ CodeQL build now compiles test, interop, fuzz, cache, stress, hardening, and benchmark C targets that were not extracted by the earlier default setup.
  - Most alerts are newly visible pre-existing code patterns, not regressions introduced by the Windows CI workflow itself.
  - Some alerts are real hygiene issues in test and benchmark code; at least two path findings and one stack-address warning touch production POSIX C code and need source review rather than dismissal.
- Decision:
  - Do not weaken CodeQL coverage or disable the rules by default.
  - First fix source patterns that are real or cheaply made explicit.
  - Use narrow suppression or workflow configuration only for remaining findings proven to be intentional test scaffolding after source review.
- Risk:
  - Production POSIX SHM path handling changes can affect SHM lifecycle, stale-file recovery, and interop tests.
  - Stack-lifetime fixes around server/session code can affect thread and signal lifetime if handled mechanically.
  - Removing stale test locals and wiring previously unused static tests is low risk but still needs CTest validation.
- Validation plan:
  - Build C targets locally with CMake.
  - Run focused C protocol, POSIX UDS/SHM/service, fuzz, and benchmark target validation.
  - Run action/static checks available locally.
  - Push and verify GitHub CodeQL alerts close or reduce to only documented intentional findings.
- Implemented:
  - Removed stale typed-call request/response locals from C service, chaos, and benchmark tests.
  - Wired dormant C protocol coverage tests into `test_protocol` and relaxed one overly-specific synthetic-overflow assertion to require rejection rather than a single error code.
  - Removed an unused SHM test helper.
  - Fixed portable `uint32_t` formatting in the C ping-pong test.
  - Changed the C payload-limit test overflow fixture to use static storage instead of sharing a stack buffer with server handler state.
  - Changed POSIX benchmark timer threads to receive heap-owned duration arguments instead of stack addresses.
  - Changed POSIX SHM stale recovery and attach/create paths to open session files with `openat()` relative to a validated directory file descriptor and to unlink with `unlinkat()` where the directory identity matters.
  - Added a C interop/benchmark run-directory helper requiring existing absolute non-symlink directories owned by the current user and not group/world writable.
  - Removed C interop/benchmark helper-side `mkdir(run_dir)` calls; repo scripts already create the temporary run directories.
  - Changed the C codec interop fixture writer to create files with explicit `0600` mode.
  - Changed the standalone C fuzz harness to read bytes from stdin only and updated the extended fuzz script accordingly.
  - Changed the UDS stale-recovery regular-file test fixture to use explicit `0600` file creation.
- Local validation:
  - `cmake --build build --target netipc_shm netipc_service test_protocol test_uds test_shm test_service test_service_payload_limits test_chaos test_ping_pong fuzz_protocol interop_codec_c interop_uds_c interop_shm_c interop_service_c interop_cache_c bench_posix_c` passed.
  - `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R '^(test_protocol|test_uds|test_shm|test_service|test_service_payload_limits|test_chaos|test_ping_pong|fuzz_protocol_30s|interop_codec|test_uds_interop|test_shm_interop|test_service_interop|test_cache_interop)$'` passed: 13/13 focused tests.
  - `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json` passed with 0 issues and 0 errors across Checkov, Opengrep/Semgrep, Trivy, cppcheck, ShellCheck, and Spectral.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh` passed.
  - Sensitive-data scan across the touched durable artifacts returned no matches.

### 2026-06-04 Expanded CodeQL Findings - Second Slice

- After commit `7c590c3`, the open GitHub code-scanning alerts visible during the in-progress CodeQL run dropped from 56 to 19.
- Remaining GitHub code-scanning evidence:
  - `cpp/path-injection`: 11 high alerts in C interop fixtures, the POSIX benchmark helper, and production POSIX service SHM attach flow.
  - `cpp/stack-address-escape`: 3 warning alerts in the POSIX benchmark helper and production POSIX service managed-session pointer flow.
  - `cpp/unused-local-variable`: 3 note alerts in C protocol/service tests.
  - `cpp/wrong-type-format-argument`: 1 high alert in the C ping-pong test output.
  - `cpp/long-switch`: 1 note alert in a C UDS malformed-response test helper.
- Root-cause model:
  - The remaining low-severity local-variable, format, and long-switch findings are source hygiene issues and should be fixed directly.
  - The POSIX benchmark stack warnings are source-lifetime issues around a global stop pointer to a stack server object and should be fixed directly.
  - The production service stack warning is an ownership/lifetime pattern: per-session threads store the managed server pointer and the server lifecycle owns thread shutdown before destruction. This needs source review before changing the API shape.
  - The remaining path-injection alerts persist even after helper-side directory validation because CodeQL still tracks command-line `run_dir` into NetIPC APIs and file-opening sinks.
- Decision:
  - Continue fixing direct source hygiene findings.
  - Do not disable the `cpp/path-injection` rule globally.
  - For path-injection, prefer code changes that make file access relative to trusted directory descriptors. If CodeQL still flags test-only validated runtime directories, record the false-positive evidence before any narrow suppression.
- Validation plan:
  - Rebuild the touched C targets.
  - Re-run focused CTest slices for protocol, UDS, service, interop, and benchmark-adjacent targets.
  - Re-run Codacy local analysis, whitespace checks, SOW audit, and GitHub CodeQL after push.
- Implemented:
  - Fixed the C ping-pong test generation formatter by matching `uint64_t generation` with `PRIu64`.
  - Removed remaining stale local variables from C protocol and service tests.
  - Split the long UDS malformed-response switch cases into focused helper functions without changing the malformed bytes sent by the tests.
  - Changed the POSIX benchmark server objects from stack-owned objects exposed through `g_server` to heap-owned objects destroyed and freed on exit.
  - Changed POSIX SHM create/attach directory opening from `open(run_dir, ...)` to `opendir()` plus `dirfd()` and kept file operations directory-relative with `openat()`.
  - Changed POSIX UDS stale socket unlink recovery from `open(run_dir, ...)` to `opendir()` plus `dirfd()` and kept unlink recovery directory-relative with `unlinkat()`.
  - Changed the C codec interop fixture to open the validated run directory once and read/write fixture files with `openat()` relative to that directory fd.
  - Added one narrow `cpp/stack-address-escape` source suppression at the POSIX managed-server session back-pointer assignment, with the lifecycle reason recorded in source. The public API remains stack-friendly and `nipc_server_destroy()` joins session threads before the caller may safely release the server object.
- Local validation:
  - `cmake --build build --target test_protocol test_uds test_service test_ping_pong bench_posix_c` passed.
  - `cmake --build build --target netipc_shm netipc_uds netipc_service interop_codec_c interop_uds_c interop_shm_c interop_service_c interop_cache_c bench_posix_c test_uds test_shm test_service test_ping_pong` passed.
  - `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R '^(test_protocol|test_uds|test_shm|test_service|test_service_payload_limits|test_ping_pong|interop_codec|test_uds_interop|test_shm_interop|test_service_interop|test_cache_interop)$'` passed: 11/11 focused tests.
  - `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json` passed with 0 issues and 0 errors across Checkov, Opengrep/Semgrep, Trivy, cppcheck, ShellCheck, and Spectral.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh` passed.
  - Sensitive-data scan across touched durable artifacts found only existing synthetic test `AUTH_TOKEN` constants and generic SOW policy text; no raw credentials or private data were added.
- GitHub validation:
  - Commit `ee88933` was pushed to `main`.
  - GitHub custom CodeQL run `26955852359` passed for C/C++ POSIX, C/C++ Windows, Go POSIX, Go Windows, and Rust.
  - GitHub default CodeQL run `26955850096` passed.
  - GitHub Static Analysis run `26955852120` passed.
  - GitHub Runtime Safety run `26955852110` passed.
  - GitHub Codacy Local Analysis run `26955852168` passed.
  - GitHub Codacy Coverage run `26955852119` passed.
  - GitHub Supply Chain Security run `26955852224` passed.
  - `gh api '/repos/netdata/plugin-ipc/code-scanning/alerts?state=open&branch=main&per_page=100'` returned an empty list after C/C++ POSIX CodeQL uploaded results.
  - The only remaining CodeQL alert after source fixes was `7633`, `cpp/stack-address-escape`, at `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:1484`.
  - Alert `7633` was dismissed as `false positive` with this evidence: `docs/getting-started.md:191` documents stack-owned `nipc_managed_server_t` usage, and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c:1603` begins `nipc_server_destroy()`, which joins all session threads before the caller may release the server object.

### 2026-06-04 C Protocol File Split

- The user approved trying a one-file-at-a-time complexity approach on `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c`.
- Implemented a C-only source split with no public header/API changes:
  - kept core envelope, batch, hello, increment, string-reverse, dispatch helpers, and layout assertions in `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c`.
  - added private shared wire definitions and `mul_would_overflow()` in `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol_internal.h`.
  - moved cgroups snapshot request/response/builder implementation to `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol_cgroups.c`.
  - added shared lookup label/layout helper declarations and implementation in `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol_lookup_common.h` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol_lookup_common.c`.
  - moved cgroups-lookup request/response/builder implementation to `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol_cgroups_lookup.c`.
  - moved apps-lookup request/response/builder implementation to `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol_apps_lookup.c`.
  - updated `CMakeLists.txt` so the `netipc_protocol` static library links all protocol implementation files.
  - updated `docs/code-organization.md` with the architecture rule that each service-kind codec API must have its own file in C, Rust, and Go; shared helpers may live in common files.
- Size result:
  - before: `netipc_protocol.c` had 2448 lines and Lizard reported 1973 NLOC, 81 functions, average CCN 5.5.
  - after:
    - `netipc_protocol.c`: 650 lines, 479 NLOC.

  - Specs: no update needed because public protocol/API behavior and wire bytes are unchanged.
  - End-user/operator docs: no update needed because public usage is unchanged.
  - End-user/operator skills: no update needed because exported/operator workflow is unchanged.
  - SOW lifecycle: target remains part of active `SOW-0014`; SOW remains in progress pending metric re-check and next selected hotspot.

### 2026-06-04 Rust And Go Lookup Codec File Split

- The user requested continuing the code-organization fix after the C protocol split.
- Implemented Rust and Go source splits to match the approved rule that each service-kind codec owns its own implementation file:
  - Rust `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup.rs` is now a small module wrapper.
  - Rust shared lookup helpers live in `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup/common.rs`.
  - Rust cgroups lookup implementation lives in `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup/cgroups_lookup.rs`.
  - Rust apps lookup implementation lives in `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup/apps_lookup.rs`.
  - Go `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup.go` is now a package stub retained to avoid deleting the file.
  - Go shared lookup helpers live in `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup_common.go`.
  - Go cgroups lookup implementation lives in `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/cgroups_lookup.go`.
  - Go apps lookup implementation lives in `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/apps_lookup.go`.
  - Go `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/lookup_test.go` was left unchanged in this pass because its largest remaining mixed tests deliberately exercise shared lookup validation, bounds, and dispatch behavior across both lookup codecs.
  - `docs/code-organization.md` now reflects the Rust and Go protocol layout.
- Size result:
  - Rust before: `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup.rs` had 1987 lines.
  - Rust after:
    - `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/lookup.rs`: 9 lines.

### 2026-06-04 Rust Raw Service File Split

- The user approved applying the same per-service/per-method organization rule to `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs`.
- Implemented Rust raw source split:
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` is now a wrapper module with module declarations and compatibility re-exports.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/common.rs` contains shared sizing and scratch-buffer helpers.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/client.rs` contains raw client state, lifecycle, retry, transport send/receive, response borrowing, and the unified request-buffer call path.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/server.rs` contains managed server state, accept loops, and platform-specific prepared-SHM setup.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/server_session_unix.rs` contains the POSIX raw server session loop.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/server_session_windows.rs` contains the Windows raw server session loop.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/dispatch.rs` contains shared dispatch helpers and dispatch error mapping.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/cgroups_snapshot.rs` contains cgroups snapshot typed raw calls, handler alias, and dispatch adapter.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/cgroups_lookup.rs` contains cgroups lookup typed raw calls, handler alias, and dispatch adapter.

  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/cgroups_cache.rs` contains the cgroups Level 3 cache implementation.
- Size result:
  - Before: `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` had 2811 lines.
  - After:
    - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs`: 65 lines.
    - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/apps_lookup.rs`: 91 lines.
    - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/cgroups_cache.rs`: 215 lines.

    - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/server_session_windows.rs`: 233 lines.
    - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/string_reverse.rs`: 53 lines.
- Behavior-preservation notes:
  - Public Rust typed facades in `service/cgroups.rs`, `service/cgroups_lookup.rs`, and `service/apps_lookup.rs` are unchanged.
  - Existing raw helper names remain re-exported from `service::raw`.
  - Small fixed requests now use the same request-buffer path as dynamic and batch requests; this removes duplicate retry/envelope/send code while preserving response validation and borrowing semantics.
  - POSIX and Windows raw session loops remain separate because they encode different transport wait, SHM, close, and lifecycle behavior.
- Validation:
  - `cargo fmt --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml -- --check` passed.
  - `cargo test --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml --lib -- --nocapture` passed: 332 Rust library tests.

  - `bash tests/test_service_shm_interop.sh` passed with fresh Rust fixture binaries: 9/9 C/Rust/Go SHM service interop pairs.
  - `bash tests/test_cache_interop.sh` passed with fresh Rust fixture binaries: 9/9 C/Rust/Go cache interop pairs.
  - `bash tests/test_cache_shm_interop.sh` passed with fresh Rust fixture binaries: 9/9 C/Rust/Go SHM cache interop pairs.
  - Windows/MSYS Rust validation on `win11` passed: `cargo.exe test --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml` ran 225 Windows library tests, all fixture/benchmark binary test harnesses, and doc-tests.
  - `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json` passed with 0 issues and 0 errors across Checkov, Opengrep/Semgrep, Trivy, cppcheck, ShellCheck, and Spectral.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh` passed and reported SOW initialization complete and clean.
  - Sensitive-data scan across the touched SOW, docs, and Rust raw-service files returned no matches.
- Artifact impact:
  - `AGENTS.md`: no workflow or guardrail change.
  - Runtime project skills: no reusable workflow change.
  - Specs: no public protocol/API behavior change; no spec update needed.
  - End-user/operator docs: `docs/code-organization.md` updated because repository layout and service-addition guidance changed.
  - End-user/operator skills: `docs/netipc-integrator-skill.md` updated so downstream integrator guidance points service/method-specific Rust raw code at the new child-file layout.
  - SOW lifecycle: target remains part of active `SOW-0014`; SOW remains in progress pending metric re-check and the next selected hotspot.

### Target Gate - Organization Completion Sweep

Problem / root-cause model:

- The repository now documents a stricter organization rule: service-kind codec code and service/method-specific raw/service code must live in service-kind-specific files.
- The Rust raw split fixed one high-value surface, but a fresh review found older mixed-service implementation still present in C and Go.
- Working theory: most remaining gaps can be corrected by source movement and small wrapper extraction, without changing public APIs, wire bytes, transport behavior, retry behavior, or platform lifecycle loops.

Evidence reviewed:

- `docs/code-organization.md` per-codec rule: custom request/response codec code for one codec must not be mixed with another codec.
- `docs/code-organization.md` service rule: custom typed client calls, typed handler aliases, dispatch adapters, and Level 3 cache logic for one service kind must live in service-kind-specific files.
- `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/types.go` mixes all raw handler aliases and dispatch adapters.
- `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/client.go` and `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/client_windows.go` mix platform raw lifecycle with service-specific raw constructors and typed calls.
- `src/go/pkg/netipc/service/raw/lookup_client.go` mixes cgroups lookup and apps lookup raw typed calls.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol.c` still contains increment, string-reverse, and all typed protocol dispatch helpers.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/protocol/netipc_protocol_internal.h` mixes service-specific wire structs for cgroups snapshot and lookup codecs.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_common.c` has one mixed typed dispatch switch and cgroups cache implementation in the common service file.
- `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service.c` and `src/libnetdata/netipc/src/service/netipc_service_win.c` contain all typed C client calls and all typed server initializers.
- `src/go/pkg/netipc/protocol/frame.go` keeps service-specific codec sizing constants in the frame/envelope file.

Affected contracts and surfaces:

- C protocol implementation files and `CMakeLists.txt`.
- C service implementation files and C service build target inputs.
- Go protocol package internals.
- Go raw service package internals.
- Public C, Rust, and Go APIs must remain source-compatible.
- Protocol wire bytes and cross-language interop must remain unchanged.

Existing patterns to reuse:

- Rust raw wrapper plus child-file layout from `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw.rs` and `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/`.
- Rust and Go lookup protocol split using common lookup helpers plus per-codec files.
- C protocol split using a core source file plus codec-specific files linked into the same static library.
- Keep POSIX/Windows lifecycle/session files explicit when platform behavior differs.

Risk and blast radius:

- Medium. The intended work is mostly source organization, but the C and Go service paths include retry, response borrowing, batch handling, cache refresh, and POSIX/Windows build tags.
- Main regression risks are missed symbol movement, build-tag mistakes, changed Go exported raw helper names, changed C static-library source list, changed handler storage, changed retry behavior, or Windows-only compile failures.

Sensitive data handling plan:

- Do not read `.env`.
- Do not write secrets, credentials, tokens, customer data, personal data, private endpoints, or proprietary details into code, docs, skills, specs, or SOW artifacts.

Implementation plan:

1. Split Go raw service-specific constructors, typed calls, handler aliases, dispatch adapters, and cgroups cache code into service/method-specific files; keep platform lifecycle code in POSIX/Windows files.
2. Split C protocol increment, string-reverse, cgroups snapshot dispatch, cgroups lookup dispatch, apps lookup dispatch, and service-specific internal wire structs into codec-specific files/headers.
3. Split C service typed call/init/dispatch/cache code into service-kind files while keeping POSIX/Windows connection/session/accept lifecycle code in platform files.
4. Move Go protocol service-specific sizing constants out of `frame.go` into the relevant codec files.
5. Re-run the organization review after each slice and continue until no remaining non-test mixed service-specific implementation is found.

Validation plan:

- Go: `gofmt`, `go test -C src/go ./pkg/netipc/protocol ./pkg/netipc/service/raw ./pkg/netipc/service/cgroups ./pkg/netipc/service/cgroups_lookup ./pkg/netipc/service/apps_lookup`, `go test -C src/go ./...`, and Windows Go compile/test slices where build tags changed.
- C: `cmake --build build`, focused protocol/service CTest slices, POSIX service/cache interop scripts, and Windows/MSYS build/tests if C service files change.
- Cross-language: `bash tests/interop_codec.sh` after protocol movement and service/cache interop scripts after service movement.
- Static/hygiene: `codacy-analysis analyze --output-format json`, `git diff --check`, `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh`, and sensitive-data scan over touched durable artifacts.

Artifact impact plan:

- `AGENTS.md`: no workflow or guardrail change expected.
- Runtime project skills: no reusable workflow change expected.
- Specs: no public protocol/API behavior change expected; update only if this sweep exposes a contract mismatch.
- End-user/operator docs: update `docs/code-organization.md` and `docs/netipc-integrator-skill.md` if file layout or service-addition guidance changes.
- End-user/operator skills: update only if exported/operator integration guidance changes.
- SOW lifecycle: record each split, validation evidence, remaining gaps, and final same-failure search result in this SOW.

### 2026-06-04 Organization Completion Sweep

  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/cgroups.rs` preserves the historical module path as re-export-only compatibility.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/protocol/tests.rs` now contains the large mixed protocol unit-test module; `protocol/mod.rs` is runtime-only plus module wiring and generic constants.
  - `src/crates/netipc/src/service/raw/client.rs`, `client_call.rs`, `client_unix.rs`, and `client_windows.rs` split raw client state, raw-call flow, and platform connection behavior.

  - `docs/code-organization.md` now documents per-codec files, per-service public facades, raw service child files, and compatibility modules/packages.
  - `docs/netipc-integrator-skill.md` now points to the service-kind implementation files and labels compatibility paths.
  - `docs/getting-started.md`, Go fixtures, Go benchmark drivers, and coverage/race scripts now use `service/cgroups_snapshot` as the primary Go implementation path.
- Same-failure search result:
  - Shared runtime protocol files searched: C `netipc_protocol.c` and `netipc_protocol_internal.h`, Go `frame.go` and `lookup_common.go`, Rust `protocol/mod.rs` and `protocol/lookup/common.rs`.
  - Shared runtime service files searched: C POSIX/Windows common/platform/client/server split files, Go raw client/server/types/lookup-common files, Rust raw client/client-call/server/session/common files.
  - No remaining non-test service/method-specific implementation was found in shared runtime files.
  - Remaining service-specific shared-file hits are intentional module declarations, method-code constants, compatibility-only alias files/modules, public aggregate headers, or test-only files.
- Size result after the final flow split:
  - C `netipc_protocol.c`: 364 lines.
  - C POSIX service split files: 166, 120, 173, 246, 417, and 320 lines.
  - C Windows service split files: 170, 121, 181, 237, 497, and 249 lines.
  - Go raw client/server split files: 236, 215, 202, 28, 409, and 452 lines.
  - Rust raw client/server split files: 272, 386, 113, 166, and 215 lines; `raw.rs` wrapper is 74 lines.
- Validation:
  - `cmake --build build` passed.
  - `/usr/bin/ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` passed: 46/46 POSIX tests.
  - `go test -C src/go ./...` passed.
  - Windows Go compile checks passed for protocol, raw, cgroups-snapshot, cgroups compatibility, cgroups-lookup, and apps-lookup packages.
  - `cargo fmt --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml --check` passed.
  - `cargo test --manifest-path src/crates/netipc/Cargo.toml` passed: 332 Rust library tests plus fixture/benchmark binary harnesses and doc-tests.
  - `bash tests/interop_codec.sh` passed; C, Rust, and Go decode paths all passed and generated byte-identical fixture files.
  - `bash tests/test_service_interop.sh` passed: 9/9 C/Rust/Go service interop pairs.
  - Windows/MSYS temp validation on `win11` passed: full configure/build and `/usr/bin`-equivalent CTest in `build-win` passed 25/25 Windows tests.
  - `codacy-analysis analyze --files <changed/new files> --output-format json` passed on 108 changed/new files with 0 issues and 0 errors. The run explicitly filtered out repo-root `.env`.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - `bash .agents/sow/audit.sh` passed and reported SOW initialization complete and clean.
- Artifact impact:
  - `AGENTS.md`: no workflow or guardrail change.
  - Runtime project skills: no reusable workflow change.
  - Specs: no public protocol/API behavior or wire-format change; no spec update needed beyond code-organization docs.
  - End-user/operator docs: `docs/code-organization.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, and `docs/netipc-integrator-skill.md` updated for the new implementation paths and compatibility notes.
  - End-user/operator skills: `docs/netipc-integrator-skill.md` updated because downstream integration guidance references implementation roots.
  - SOW lifecycle: SOW remains in progress until the user decides whether to close this maintainability target or continue with the next complexity/duplication hotspot.

## Lessons Extracted

- Compatibility paths should be alias-only when renaming service-kind implementation files or packages.
- Test-only mixed modules can still inflate file complexity; moving Rust protocol tests out of `protocol/mod.rs` reduced the shared runtime file from 2459 lines to 624 lines without changing runtime behavior.
- Shared raw infrastructure should split by flow once it grows: platform helpers, public API/config, connect/reconnect, raw call send/receive/retry, server lifecycle, and server session loops are different responsibilities.

## Followup

- No concrete deferred implementation remains in this SOW.
- No remaining service/method organization gap is currently known in the touched runtime files.
- Further complexity or duplication work should start from fresh Codacy/GitHub evidence and a new target-specific SOW or explicit reopening decision.

## Regression Log

None yet.
